/**
 * This file contains an example of an iterative (Non-Linear) "OpMode".
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When an selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode
 * class is instantiated on the Robot Controller and executed.
 *
 * Remove a @Disabled the on the next line or two (if present) to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list,
 * or add a @Disabled annotation to prevent this OpMode from being added to the Driver Station
